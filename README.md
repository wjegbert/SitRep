# SitRep
If you're like me, out of shape and stupid, then the agony of working out is only compounded by the fact that you have to count and remember numbers. While you're focused on contorting your body into unnatural shapes, it's all too easy to forget which number  comes after 6. That's why I created SitRep.

This revolution in personal fitness leverages a cutting-edge computer vision library and passable Python code to track your face as you're doing sit ups. You put your laptop or webcam at your feet as you exercise, and it counts the number of times your face appears over your knees, keeping track of your repetitions because you're too lazy to do it yourself, and you don't have any friends to spot you.
