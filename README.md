# SitRep
If you're like me, out of shape and stupid, then the agony of working out is only compounded by the fact that you have to count and remember numbers. Under the strain of physical activity, it's all too easy to forget which number comes after 6. That's why I created SitRep.

This revolution in personal fitness leverages a cutting-edge computer vision library (OpenCV) and servicable Python code to track your face as you're doing sit ups. Put your laptop or webcam at your feet as you exercise, and the app will count the number of times your face becomes visible, so when it sees your face above your knees, it will count that as a repetition. A system bell will sound every time your face is detected, so you can be sure it is keeping the right count. I know what you're thinking: that seems like it will get really annoying really quick. But something you might not have considered is shut up.

## FAQs
Why does it take a few seconds for the program to start doing stuff?
There's a short convenience buffer when you start the program that allows you to get in position and prepare yourself mentally for the unnatural contortions your body is about to endure.

Why should I use this? 
Because you're too lazy to count, and you don't have any friends to spot you.

I'm concerned about privacy. What measures do you take to ensure my data is secure and my webcam isn't being hijacked?
lol
